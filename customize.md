Theme
=====

The default theme of Urubu Quickstart is based on the stock [bootstrap] theme.

You can easily get a different look and feel thanks to [bootswatch] This
project develops a number of themes as drop-in replacements for Bootstrap.
Simply set the `bootswatch` variable in `_site.yml` to the name of the desired
theme, such as `flatly`, `yeti` or `lumen`.

Within a theme, you can change the look of the navbar by setting
`navbar_inverse` to `true`.

Footer
======

You can customize the content of the page footer
in the `_layout/footer.html` file.

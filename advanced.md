Layouts
=======

All layouts are defined in the `_layout` subdirectory.  They are implemented as
[Jinja2 Templates][jinja2].  You can modify existing layouts or create new
ones. You can use *template inheritance* to implement just the desired feature
in a layout, and reuse everything else from the parent layout. 

Bootstrap
=========

Urubu was designed to work well with [bootstrap], a framework of ready-to-use
website components, style sheets and javascript functions. You can use
Bootstrap features to customize your layouts. Alternatively, you can switch to
another framework altogether.

Tags
====

Urubu supports tags. This is described in the [manual][2].
